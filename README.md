# Machine Learning Models & Data Processing

This repository contains three different machine learning projects, each designed to explore different models and techniques for image classification, image generation and data processing.

## Projects

1. **CNN for Image Classification**
   - This project demonstrates the use of deep learning models for image classification, utilizing Keras and TensorFlow for building and training the models. The project involves using the tiny-imagenet dataset and includes training, evaluation, and testing the models.
   
2. **SVM, KNN and NCC for Image Classification**
   - This project focuses on a Support Vector Machine for image classification for the Cifar-10 dataset. Other techniques are used, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Nearest Class Centroid (NCC) and a Convolutional Neural Network for comparison. It involves testing the above methods on the dataset and comparing their performance.

3. **Encoder-Decoder Network for MNIST Image Generation**
   - In this project, we implement an Encoder-Decoder Network to output images the MNIST dataset format of mathematical operations from 3 input images, two numbers and an operator. The model is tested, and detailed output images are evaluated to showcase the performance of the network.

## Clone the Repository

```bash

## Results

Results for each project can be found in the respective output files or in the generated logs. These results include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant data to assess model performance.
