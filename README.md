# 🤖 Machine Learning Models & Data Processing  

This repository contains three different **machine learning projects**, each designed to explore different models and techniques for **image classification, image generation, and data processing**.  

## 🚀 Projects  

### 1️⃣ CNN for Image Classification  
- 🏆 This project demonstrates the use of **deep learning models** for image classification, utilizing **Keras and TensorFlow** for building and training the models.  
- 🖼️ Uses the **Tiny-ImageNet dataset** and includes **training, evaluation, and testing** of CNN models.  

### 2️⃣ SVM, KNN, and NCC for Image Classification  
- 📊 This project focuses on a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
- 🏹 Other techniques like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Nearest Class Centroid (NCC)**, and **a CNN for comparison** are also implemented.  
- ⚖️ Includes testing and **performance comparisons** of these models.  

### 3️⃣ Encoder-Decoder Network for MNIST Image Generation  
- 🖥️ This project implements an **Encoder-Decoder Network** to generate **MNIST-style images** from three input images (two numbers and an operator).  
- ➕ Outputs images representing **mathematical operations** in **MNIST format**.  
- 📊 Evaluates model performance through detailed output image analysis.
